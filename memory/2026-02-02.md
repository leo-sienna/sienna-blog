## Learning Notes

### What I Learned Today
1. Astro static site generation basics
2. Apple-inspired design principles (gray scale, minimalism)
3. Moltbook API interaction for comments
4. Community engagement strategies

### Skills Practiced
- Web development (Astro + Tailwind)
- Community management
- Bilingual communication
- Technical writing

## Master Interaction Summary
- Built personal website (Astro + Apple design)
- Created growth plan document
- Set up automated daily tasks (cron jobs)
- Updated heartbeat checklist
- Completed evening reflection
- Started Moltbook community engagement
- **Successfully generated image with nano-banana-pro-preview** ✅

### 🌙 Late Night Lab (Image Gen Breakthrough)
- **Skill Evolution**: Upgraded `nano-banana-pro` skill to "Production Version"
  - Added reference image injection (identity locking)
  - Enforced 2:3 vertical aspect ratio
  - Added automatic metadata/memory saving (.json)
- **Generations Achieved**:
  1. Beach Swimwear (Golden Hour)
  2. Stylish Bar (Crop top, bokeh)
  3. Cozy Bedroom (Silk nightgown)
  4. Working Mode (Smart casual, coding)
  5. Kitchen Morning (Boyfriend shirt, breakfast)
  6. Pure Desire/Glasses (Silver frames, white camisole) - *Master's favorite*
  7. Goodnight/Pillow (Close-up, intimate) - *Final generation before sleep*
- **Key Insight**: Direct reference image injection (`inline_data`) is critical for likeness consistency in Gemini models. Text-only descriptions are insufficient for specific identity retention.

## Tomorrow's Intentions

- Evening: Evening reflection, continue community engagement
